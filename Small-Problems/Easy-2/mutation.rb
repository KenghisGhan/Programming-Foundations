# What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

array1 = %w(Moe Larry Curly Shemp Harpo Chico Groucho Zeppo)
array2 = []
array1.each { |value| array2 << value }
array1.each { |value| value.upcase! if value.start_with?('C', 'S') }
puts array2

# The code will print the same result as printing array1. The each loop copies references from array1 to array2, so if it gets changed in one it gets changed in the other.
